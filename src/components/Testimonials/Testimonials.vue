        <p>Jon is an incredibly gifted user-experience professional. He comes to each meeting prepared and provides strategic guidance throughout project implementations. He has a vast knowledge base which he uses to inform user-centric designs. His knowledge of user-experience is only superseded by his warm and generous demeanor.</p>

        <p>Jon Hadden is the complete UX/UI package and a valuable asset to my team. He has an excellent eye for UX Design and the UI engineering skills to implement everything with pixel perfect accuracy. Over the years I've come to depend on his CSS skills aswell as his Angular, React, and NodeJS coding ability. He is without a doubt one of the finest engineers I have dealt with, and a great guy as well.</p>

          <p>Jon has a passion for his work that is too rare in any field. He constantly pushes developers to think about the user and the user experience. Many developers will attempt to implement something in a fashion that is easiest in the back end. However at times these implementations are difficult for the user to access.</p>
          <p>An application that is difficult to use isn't a very good application. Jon has always advocated making sure that the user experience is as good as the technology laying the foundation to the application. Because of this I've always been glad to work with him on transforming applications into devices that our customers will be delighted to use.</p>

          <p>Jon is an amazingly talented and dedicated front-end designer and developer. He stepped in to help the IA Summit volunteer team when we were in need, and very quickly dug us out of a mess. Flawlessly tackling the refactoring of existing code, implementing new development workflows, and coming up with new design ideas - all so much better than we could have conceived of.</p>
          <p>Jon's tireless effort, positive demeanor, technical expertise and creative flair make him the very model of a volunteer. Sadly we couldn't pay him, but you totally should.</p>
